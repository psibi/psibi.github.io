title: Logic & Plan

Ok, so for the past few weeks I have been working on Logic.(Ugh, I
still haven't integrated Disqus into this blog :-( ). I have been
studying propositional and predicate calculus and things seems to be
interesting and very challenging (The conditional implication was
mindbending!). Also, I'm planning to take up Keith Devlin's course in
Coursera once it starts (and hopefully complete it this time!).

Also, I'm making a personal note to look on these topics in a more
detailed fashion once I get some time:

* Functional Dependency
    * Patterson condition
    * Coverage Condition
    * Liberal Coverage Condition
* GADTs
* Type families
    * Closed type families
* Existential data types.
* Rank N Types
* Church Encoding
* Template Haskell
* Generics
* Continuations
* Delimited Continuations
* Lens

The full credits for the above list goes to the discussion in the
[cafe mailing list](http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2014-July/115259.html).
