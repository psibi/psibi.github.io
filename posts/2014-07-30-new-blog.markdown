After a lot of thinking, I finally decided to migrate from
[blogger](http://blog.psibi.in) to a Hakyll based blog. I wanted to
really like the blogger platform, but the thought of writing posts
from Emacs vs. Blogger's web platform made this choice too easy.

Two things which I still need to do during this weekend would be:

* Integrate Disqus commenting platform
* Setup Google web analytic JS
