title: Setting up React Native
---

Finally I found some time and enough motivation to try out React
Native in my laptop. While I succeeded in running the Hello world
code, setting up the environment itself was too tricky. I'm writing
this post for a future me to look again into this whenever required.

* Don't use Xmonad
* Firefox was not able to download android studio
* Android virtual manager
* Set JAVA_HOME, ANDROID_HOME
* Exposing to PATH
