title: About
---

Origined from the port city of Tuticorin and spent most parts of my
childhood in the Awadh region Lucknow, I'm a sofware engineer with a
strong interest in Functional Programming (especially Haskell). I'm a
avid Ruskin Bond fan, like A.R.Rahman's music and usually very lazy.

I work in TCS R&D Labs as a Researcher.
