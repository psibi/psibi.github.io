<span class="heading-label">Origin, Hobbies and Interests</span>

Origined from the port city of Tuticorin and spent most parts of my
childhood in the Awadh region Lucknow, I'm a sofware engineer with a
strong interest in Functional Programming (especially Haskell). I'm a
avid Ruskin Bond fan, like A.R.Rahman's music and usually very lazy.

<span class="heading-label">Work History</span>

I previously worked in TCS R&D Labs at IIT Madras Research park as a
Researcher. Currently I'm working with a startup named Inkmonk (I'm
their first engineering hire!).
