<span class="heading-label">Origin, Hobbies and Interests</span>

Origined from the port city of Tuticorin and spent most parts of my
childhood in the Awadh region Lucknow, currently residing in Bangalore
with my wife Divya. I'm a sofware engineer with a strong interest in
Functional Programming (especially Haskell). I'm a avid Ruskin Bond
fan, like A.R.Rahman's music and usually very lazy.

<span class="heading-label">Work History</span>

I previously worked in TCS R&D Labs at IIT Madras Research Park as a
Researcher where I worked on GIS systems which were used to simulate
traffic conditions of large cities. Then, I worked on with a startup
named Inkmonk (I was their first engineering hire!) where my
responsibilities included frontend, backend and doing devops. After
that, I led a team at Pneuma Innovations where we built a Haskell
based system for inventory management systems to support QSR. Then I
moved on to work as a consultant for McKinsey & Company on some of their
health-related prototypes.
